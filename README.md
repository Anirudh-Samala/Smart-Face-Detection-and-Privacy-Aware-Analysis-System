# Face Analysis and Privacy Detection – Phase 2  
### Using Flask, OpenCV, and Pre-Trained ML Models

---

## Overview
This project analyzes human faces in uploaded images using pre-trained machine learning models.  
It detects faces, predicts emotions, identifies gender, and can apply a **privacy blur** to anonymize results.

This is **Phase 2** of the project and focuses on:
- Extending the system with a **user-friendly web UI**.
- Integrating the **existing ML models** into the UI.
- Adding **visualizations** and **validation metrics** for model performance.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Flask** – Backend web framework  
- **OpenCV** – Image processing  
- **Pre-trained Models:** Haar Cascade, DLIB, MTCNN, ResNet  
- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – Frontend UI  
- **Matplotlib / Plotly (optional)** – Visualizations

## Project Structure
Will be updated soon based on next phases
